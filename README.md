# DiabetesPrediction
Leveraging the power of decision tree algorithms, this repository presents a classifier utilizing both Gini Index and Entropy impurity measures. We aim to provide accurate diabetes predictions for patients using the 'Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset' sourced from Kaggle.
